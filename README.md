* **Anomaly Detection & Prediction:** Proactively detect and predict system anomalies before they impact users.
* **System Optimization:** Receive AI-driven suggestions to optimize resource usage and improve performance.
* **Automated Incident Reports:** Generate detailed incident reports automatically.
* **Workflow Recommendations:** Get intelligent recommendations for improving your DevOps processes.

### Advanced Monitoring
* **Comprehensive Health Scoring:** A holistic score representing the overall health of your systems.
* **Resource Trend Analysis:** Analyze historical data to understand resource usage patterns.
* **Capacity Planning:** Gain insights to make informed decisions about future resource needs.
* **Real-time Anomaly Alerts:** Instant notifications for detected anomalies.
* **Predictive Analytics:** Forecast future trends and potential issues.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following:

* Python 3.8+
* A Slack workspace with administrative access
* A running Jenkins server
* An accessible Kubernetes cluster
* A Docker environment
* A configured Prometheus server
* A Gemini API key

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/automating-devops-workflows.git](https://github.com/yourusername/automating-devops-workflows.git)
    cd automating-devops-workflows
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your credentials:
    ```env
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
    SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
    SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token
    JENKINS_URL=your-jenkins-url
    JENKINS_USER=your-jenkins-user
    JENKINS_TOKEN=your-jenkins-token
    PROMETHEUS_URL=your-prometheus-url
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
    ```

## Usage

Interact with your DevOps environment using simple Slack commands.

### Basic Commands
* `/jenkins-trigger <job_name> [params]`: Trigger a specific Jenkins job with optional parameters.
* `/jenkins-status <job_name>`: Check the status of a Jenkins job.
* `/k8s-pods [namespace]`: List all pods in a specified Kubernetes namespace.
* `/docker-ps`: List all currently running Docker containers.

### AI-Powered Commands
* `/ai-analyze-logs <source>`: Perform an AI-powered analysis of logs from Jenkins, Kubernetes, or Docker.
* `/ai-optimize`: Request AI-driven suggestions for system optimization.
* `/system-health`: Get a comprehensive health score for your monitored systems.
* `/detect-anomalies <metric> [duration]`: Scan for anomalies in a specific metric over a given time.
* `/capacity-planning`: Receive AI-generated insights for capacity planning.

## Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](architecture.png)

The solution is designed with a modular and scalable architecture:

* `app.py`: The core application that handles Slack commands and event routing.
* `ai_operations.py`: Contains the logic for all AI-powered features using the Gemini API.
* `advanced_monitoring.py`: Implements advanced monitoring and health scoring functionalities.
* `jenkins_handler.py`: Manages all interactions with the Jenkins API.
* `k8s_handler.py`: Handles operations related to the Kubernetes cluster.
* `docker_handler.py`: Manages Docker container operations.
* `prometheus_handler.py`: Integrates with Prometheus for metrics and alerts.

## Security Considerations

Security is a top priority for this solution:

* **Credential Management:** All sensitive information, such as API keys and tokens, is managed through environment variables and is never hard-coded.
* **Secure Communication:** Interactions with external APIs are conducted over secure protocols.
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and logging are in place to manage security events.
* **API Rate Limiting:** Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse of the APIs.
* **Input Sanitization:** All user inputs from Slack commands are validated to prevent injection attacks.
