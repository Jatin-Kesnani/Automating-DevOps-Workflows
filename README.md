## Features

### Core ChatOps Features
- Jenkins integration for CI/CD operations
- Kubernetes cluster management
- Docker container operations
- Prometheus-based monitoring
- Real-time system health monitoring

### AI-Powered Operations
- Log analysis and insights using Gemini AI
- Anomaly detection and prediction
- System optimization suggestions
- Incident report generation
- Workflow improvement recommendations

### Advanced Monitoring
- Comprehensive system health scoring
- Resource usage trends analysis
- Capacity planning insights
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Predictive analytics

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Slack workspace with admin access
- Jenkins server
- Kubernetes cluster
- Docker environment
- Prometheus server
- Gemini API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatops-slack-bot.git
cd chatops-slack-bot
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```env
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token
JENKINS_URL=your-jenkins-url
JENKINS_USER=your-jenkins-user
JENKINS_TOKEN=your-jenkins-token
PROMETHEUS_URL=your-prometheus-url
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands
- `/jenkins-trigger <job_name> [params]` - Trigger Jenkins jobs
- `/jenkins-status <job_name>` - Check Jenkins job status
- `/k8s-pods [namespace]` - List Kubernetes pods
- `/docker-ps` - List running Docker containers

### AI-Powered Commands
- `/ai-analyze-logs <source>` - Analyze logs from Jenkins, K8s, or Docker
- `/ai-optimize` - Get AI-powered system optimization suggestions
- `/system-health` - Get comprehensive system health score
- `/detect-anomalies <metric> [duration]` - Detect anomalies in metrics
- `/capacity-planning` - Get capacity planning insights

## Architecture

The solution is built with a modular architecture:

- `app.py` - Main application with Slack command handlers
- `ai_operations.py` - AI-powered operations using Gemini
- `advanced_monitoring.py` - Advanced monitoring capabilities
- `jenkins_handler.py` - Jenkins integration
- `k8s_handler.py` - Kubernetes operations
- `docker_handler.py` - Docker operations
- `prometheus_handler.py` - Prometheus integration

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive credentials are stored in environment variables
- API keys and tokens are never exposed in the code
- Proper error handling and logging for security events
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Input validation for all commands
